## Usage

To use the kaleidoscope generator, simply visit the live demo at [kaleidoscope-generator.netlify.com](https://kaleidoscope-generator.netlify.com/), where you can adjust the settings and see the kaleidoscope pattern update in real time. You can also customize the fragment shader code, written in GLSL, to create your own unique kaleidoscope effect.

## Technical Details

The kaleidoscope generator is built using React and TypeScript, and uses WebGL to render the kaleidoscope pattern in real time. The generator also uses a custom GLSL fragment shader to create the kaleidoscope effect, which allows for maximum flexibility and customization.

The GLSL language is used for writing the fragment shader, which is a high-level shading language designed for use in graphics processing units (GPUs).

The generator is fully responsive and works on all modern browsers and devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
